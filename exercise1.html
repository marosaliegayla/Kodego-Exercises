            Personality
        </h2>
        <!--Todo: To know him more just by knowing his personality-->
        <p>
            As a child, Suzuya's personality was somewhat normal, albeit a tad twisted, but as a result of Big Madam's treatment, he no longer felt fear, pain, nor did he have any morals. Yukinori Shinohara, his mentor, described him as a "problem child". Despite his childish and playful demeanor, he was also extremely violent and highly disturbed. He usually described his killing methods to be clean, without needless movements, which is a skill he seemed to take pride in. He shows no hesitation to kill someone. He even goes as far as to consider it a part of daily life, and lacks awareness of death's weight.
